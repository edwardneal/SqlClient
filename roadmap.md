# Microsoft.Data.SqlClient Roadmap

The Microsoft.Data.SqlClient roadmap communicates project priorities for evolving and extending the scope of the product. We encourage the community to work with us to improve SqlClient driver for these scenarios and extend it for others.

## Released Versions

- [Release Notes](release-notes/README.md) - For detailed release notes summarizing of all changes/features released.
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/sqlclient/releases) - For downloading NuGet Packages and identifying driver releases with changelog notes.

## Upcoming Ship Dates

For upcoming release dates, see [SqlClient milestones](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/milestones).

[SqlClient Projects](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/projects) are used by our development team to define roadmap of prioritized work. SqlClient Boards contain issues, pull requests, and other features, development activities that are categorized as cards. Our goal is to be transparent over priorities, work in progress and deliverables.

## Feedback

The best way to give feedback is to create issues in the [dotnet/sqlclient](https://github.com/dotnet/sqlclient) repo.

Although mostly obvious, please give us feedback that will give us insight on the following points:

* Existing features are missing some capability or otherwise don't work well enough.
* Missing features that should be added to the product.
* Design choices for a feature that is currently in-progress.

Some important caveats / notes:

* It is best to give design feedback quickly for improvements that are in-development. We're unlikely to hold a feature being part of a release on late feedback.
* We are most likely to include improvements that either have a positive impact on a broad scenario or have very significant positive impact on a niche scenario. This means that we are unlikely to prioritize modest improvements to niche scenarios.
* Compatibility will almost always be given a higher priority than improvements.
