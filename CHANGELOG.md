This update brings the following changes since the
[6.1.0-preview2](release-notes/6.1/6.1.0-preview2.md) release:

### Added

  ([#3513](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3513))

### Changed

#### SqlDecimal type workarounds conversions

*What Changed:*

- Changed how SqlDecimal type workarounds perform conversions to meet
  compliance policies.
  ([#3467](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3467))

*Who Benefits:*

- Microsoft products must not use undocumented APIs on other Microsoft products.
  This change removes calls to undocumented APIs and replaces them with
  compliant API use.

*Impact:*

- These changes impose an observed 5% decrease in performance on .NET Framework.

#### SqlVector API improvements

*What Changed:*

- Several changes were made to the SqlVector API published in the
  [6.1.0-preview2](release-notes/6.1/6.1.0-preview2.md) release
  ([#3472](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3472)):
  - The SqlVector class was changed to a readonly struct.
  - The null value constructor was changed to a static `CreateNull()` method.
  - The `Size` property was removed.

*Who Benefits:*

- SqlVector instances gain the efficiencies of struct handling.

*Impact:*

- Early-adopter applications may require updates if they rely on the old APIs
  and any class-specific behaviour.

## [Preview Release 6.1.0-preview2.25178.5] - 2025-06-27

This update brings the following changes since the
[6.1.0-preview1](release-notes/6.1/6.1.0-preview1.md) release:

### Added

#### Added dedicated SQL Server vector datatype support

*What Changed:*

- Optimized vector communications between MDS and SQL Server 2025, employing a
  custom binary format over the TDS protocol.
  ([#3433](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3433),
   [#3443](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3443))
- Reduced processing load compared to existing JSON-based vector support.
- Initial support for 32-bit single-precision floating point vectors.

*Who Benefits:*

- Applications moving large vector data sets will see beneficial improvements
  to processing times and memory requirements.
- Vector-specific APIs are ready to support future numeric representations with
  a consistent look-and-feel.

*Impact:*

- Reduced transmission and processing times for vector operations versus JSON
  using SQL Server 2025 preview:
  - Reads:  50x improvement
  - Writes: 3.3x improvement
  - Bulk Copy: 19x improvement
  - (Observed with vector column of max 1998 size, and 10,000 records for each
    operation.)
- Improved memory footprint due to the elimination of JSON
  serialization/deserialization and string representation bloat.
- For backwards compatibility with earlier SQL Server Vector implementations,
  applications may continue to use JSON strings to send/receive vector data,
  although they will not see any of the performance improvements noted above.

#### Revived .NET Standard 2.0 target support

*What Changed:*

- Support for targeting .NET Standard 2.0 has returned.
  ([#3381](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3381))
- Support had previously been removed in the 6.0 release, with the
  [community voicing concerns](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/discussions/3115).

*Who Benefits:*

- Libraries that depend on MDS may seamlessly target any of the following
  frameworks:
  - .NET Standard 2.0
  - .NET Framework 4.6.2 and above
  - .NET 8.0
  - .NET 9.0
- Applications should continue to target runtimes.
  - The MDS .NET Standard 2.0 target framework support does not include an
    actual implementation, and cannot be used with a runtime.
  - An application's build/publish process should always pick the appropriate
    MDS .NET/.NET Framework runtime implementation.
  - Custom build/publish actions that incorrectly try to deploy the MDS .NET
    Standard 2.0 reference DLL at runtime are not supported.

*Impact:*

- Libraries targeting .NET Standard 2.0 will no longer receive warnings like
  this:
  - `warning NU1701: Package 'Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 6.0.2' was restored using '.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1, .NETFramework,Version=v4.6.2, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7.1, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2, .NETFramework,Version=v4.8, .NETFramework,Version=v4.8.1' instead of the project target framework '.NETStandard,Version=v2.0'. This package may not be fully compatible with your project.`

### Fixed

- Fixed missing &lt;NeutralLanguage&gt; property.
  ([#3325](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3325))
- Fixed injection of UTF-8 BOM during bulk copy.
  ([#3399](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3399))
- Fixed `SqlCachedBuffer` async read edge case.
  ([#3329](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3329))
- Fixed `SqlSequentialTextReader` edge case with single-byte reads.
  ([#3383](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3383))
- Fixed an incorrect error message when parsing connection string `PoolBlockingPeriod`.
  ([#3411](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3411))
- Added missing `ToString()` override to `SqlJson`.
  ([#3427](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3427))

- Expanded/clarified SqlConnection's
  [AccessToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.accesstoken) and
  [AccessTokenCallback](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.accesstokencallback)

### Known issues

- When using `Encrypt=Strict` with TLS v1.3, the TLS handshake occurs twice on initial connection on .NET Framework due to a timeout during the TLS handshake and a retry helper re-establishes the connection; however, on .NET Core, it will throw a `System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (258): The wait operation timed out.` and is being investigated. If you're using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient with .NET Core on Windows 11, you will need to enable the managed SNI on Windows context switch using following statement `AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.UseManagedNetworkingOnWindows", true);` to use TLS v1.3 or disabling TLS 1.3 from the registry by assigning `0` to the following `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.3\Client\Enabled` registry key and it'll use TLS v1.2 for the connection. This will be fixed in a future release.

- The new **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.runtime** dependency adds support for the _ARM_ platform along with the already supported platforms _ARM64_, _x64_ and _x86_ on Windows [#570](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/570)
- Improved driver performance by introducing managed packet recycling [#389](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/389)

### Breaking Changes

- For .NET Framework applications consuming **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient**, the `SNI.dll` files previously downloaded to the `bin\x64` and `bin\x86` folders are now named `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.x64.dll` and `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.x86.dll` and will be downloaded to the `bin` directory, to support auto-loading in the application process [#570](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/570). This change is not going to impact client applications unless a direct reference has been made to `SNI.dll` or the x86 and x64 folders.
