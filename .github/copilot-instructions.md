## üß© SNI Implementations
There are two implementations of the SQL Server Network Interface (SNI) layer used in this project:
- **Managed SNI**: A managed implementation of SNI that is used in .NET Core and .NET 5+ environments. It provides cross-platform support for SQL Server connectivity.
- **Native SNI**: A native implementation of SNI that is used in .NET Framework and .NET Core environments on Windows. It's shipped as part of the `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI` and `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.Runtime` packages.
  - **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI**: This package provides the native SNI layer for .NET Framework applications.
  - **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.Runtime**: This package provides the native SNI layer for .NET Core applications on Windows.
